title: Finding Relevant Features for Different Times in Survival Prediction by Discrete
  Hazard Bayesian Network
abstract: When predicting the survival time of a patient, different covariates may
  be important at different times. We introduce a survival prediction model, “discrete
  hazard Bayesian network", that can provide individual survival curves and also identify
  which features are relevant for each time interval. This model encodes the discrete
  hazard function as a sequence of (possibly different) Bayesian networks, one for
  each time interval. Note each such network includes a “Death” node, which is True
  iff the person dies in that interval. A set of features relevant for each time interval
  are the nodes in the Markov blanket around that “Death" node for that interval.
  We also apply a “discrete hazard computation correction" based on the effective
  sample size – a correction that avoids biased survival curves. We first show that
  our model is effective by demonstrating that it can identify the time-varying relevance
  of the features, using the synthetic dataset. We then provide two real-world examples
  by analyzing the relevant features for different times on the North Alberta cancer
  dataset and the Norway/Stanford breast cancer dataset.
