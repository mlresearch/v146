title: 'Deep-CR MTLR: a Multi-Modal Approach for Cancer Survival Prediction with Competing
  Risks'
abstract: Accurate survival prediction is crucial for development of precision cancer
  medicine, creating the need for new sources of prognostic information. Recently,
  there has been significant interest in exploiting routinely collected clinical and
  medical imaging data to discover new prognostic markers in multiple cancer types.
  However, most of the previous studies focus on individual data modalities alone
  and do not make use of recent advances in machine learning for survival prediction.
  We present Deep-CR MTLR â€” a novel machine learning approach for accurate cancer
  survival prediction from multi-modal clinical and imaging data in the presence of
  competing risks based on neural networks and an extension of the multi-task logistic
  regression framework. We demonstrate improved prognostic performance of the multi-modal
  approach over single modality predictors in a cohort of 2552 head and neck cancer
  patients, particularly for cancer specific survival, where our approach achieves
  2-year AUROC of 0.774 and C-index of 0.788.
