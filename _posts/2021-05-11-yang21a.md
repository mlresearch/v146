title: Survival Trees for Current Status Data
abstract: Current status data arise when the exact time of an event of interest is
  not known and the only available information about the time is whether the time
  is beyond a single assessment. When interest lies in prediction based on such data,
  we define observed data loss functions through censoring unbiased transformations
  and pseudo-observations to construct unbiased estimates of complete data loss functions,
  and we use these to fit regression trees and make predictions using current status
  data. The trees grown based on these methods are found have good properties empirically
  in terms of recovery of the true tree structure and event time prediction.
