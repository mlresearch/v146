title: 'The Safe Logrank Test: Error Control under Optional Stopping, Continuation
  and Prior Misspecification'
abstract: We introduce the safe logrank test, a version of the logrank test that can
  retain type-I error guarantees under optional stopping and continuation. It allows
  for effortless combination of data from different trials on different sub-populations
  while keeping type-I error guarantees and can be extended to define always-valid
  confidence intervals. Prior knowledge can be accounted for via prior distributions
  on the hazard ratio in the alternative, but even under ‘bad’ priors Type I error
  bounds are guaranteed. The test is an instance of the recently developed martingale
  tests based on e-values. Initial experiments show that the safe logrank test performs
  well in terms of the maximal and the expected amount of events needed to obtain
  a desired power.
