title: Beta Survival Models
abstract: Survival modeling is an important area of study, and has been used widely
  in many applications including clinical research, online advertising, manufacturing,
  etc. There are many methods to consider when analyzing survival problems, however
  these techniques generally focus on either estimating the uncertainty of different
  risk factors (cox-proportional hazards, etc), or predicting the time to event in
  a non-parametric way (e.g. tree based methods), or forecasting the survival beyond
  an observed horizon (parametric techniques such as exponential). In this work, we
  introduce efficient estimation methods for linear, tree, and neural network versions
  of the Beta-Logistic model - a classical extension of the logistic function into
  the discrete survival setting. The Beta-Logistic allows for recovery of the underlying
  beta distribution as well as having the advantages of non-linear or tree based techniques
  while still allowing for projecting beyond an observed horizon. Empirical results
  using simulated data as well as large-scale data-sets across three use-cases (online
  conversions, retention modeling in a subscription service, and survival of democracies
  and dictatorships), demonstrate the competitiveness of the method at these tasks.
  The simplicity of the method and its ability to capture skew in the data makes it
  a viable alternative to standard techniques particularly when we are interested
  in forecasting time to event beyond our observed horizon and when the underlying
  probabilities are heterogeneous.
