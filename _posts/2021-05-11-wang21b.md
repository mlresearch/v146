title: Kullback-Leibler-Based Discrete Relative Risk Models for Integration of Published
  Prediction Models with New Dataset
abstract: Existing literature for prediction of time-to-event data has primarily focused
  on risk factors from a single individual-level dataset. However, these analyses
  may suffer from small sample sizes, high dimensionality and low signal-to-noise
  ratios. To improve prediction stability and better understand risk factors associated
  with outcomes of interest, we propose a Kullback-Leibler-based discrete relative
  risk modeling procedure to borrow information from existing models. Simulations
  and real data analysis were conducted to show the advantage of the proposed method
  compared with those solely based on data from current study or prior information.
