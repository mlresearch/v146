title: 'IDNetwork: A deep Illness-Death Network based on multi-states event history
  process for versatile disease prognostication'
abstract: Multi-state models can capture the different patterns of disease evolution.
  In particular, the illness-death model is used to follow disease progression from
  a healthy state to an intermediate state and to a death-related final state. We
  aim to use those models in order to adapt treatment decisions according to the evolution
  of the disease. In state-of-the-art methods, the risks of transition are modeled
  via (semi-) Markov processes and transition-specific Cox proportional hazard (P.H.)
  models. We propose a neural network architecture called IDNetwork (Illness-Death
  Network) that relaxes the linear Cox P.H. assumption and integrates a large number
  of patients’ characteristics. Our method significantly improves the predictive performance
  compared to state-of-the-art methods on a simulated data set, on two clinical trials
  for patients with colon cancer and on a real-world data set in breast cancer.
