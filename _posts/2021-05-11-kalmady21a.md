title: Improving the Calibration of Long Term Predictions of Heart Failure Rehospitalizations
  using Medical Concept Embedding
abstract: "‘Medical concept embedding’ aims to provide vector representations of International
  Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes such that the relationship between
  two vectors mirrors the conceptual relationship between the two diagnoses or clinical
  interventions. Despite the growing interest in vector representations of clinical
  information in electronic health records (EHR), the utility of embedding methods
  has not been examined in the context of predicting individualized survival distributions
  (ISD). In this study, we apply ISD methods, specifically Cox-Proportional Hazards
  with Kalbfleisch-Prentice extension (CoxPH-KP) and Multi-task Logistic Regression
  (MTLR), to the task of predicting probability of Heart Failure (HF) rehospitalization
  or mortality, in a population-level database of 40,568 HF hospitalizations over
  the span of 8 years. Further, we compare performance of these ISD models with versus
  without code embeddings, that were learned in a temporally disjoint dataset of 229,359
  all-cause hospitalizations. All our models show good discrimination in the validation
  dataset of 8,114 HF hospitalizations, with time-based concordance greater than 70%
  for every monthly intervals upto 8 years. Finally, we demonstrate that medical concept
  embedding does not always lead to improved model discrimination, but does improve
  model calibration, particularly over the longer time scales."
