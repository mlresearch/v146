title: Theory and software for boosted nonparametric hazard estimation
abstract: Nonparametric approaches for analyzing survival data in the presence of
  time-dependent covariates is a timely topic, given the availability of high frequency
  data capture systems in healthcare and beyond. We present a theoretically justified
  gradient boosted hazard estimator for this setting, and describe a tree-based implementation
  called BoXHED (pronounced ‘box-head’) that is available from GitHub:www.github.com/BoXHED.
  Our numerical study demonstrates that there is a place in the machine learning toolbox
  for a nonparametric method like BoXHED that can flexibly handle time-dependent covariates.
  The results presented here are distilled from the recent works of Lee et al. (2021)
  and Wang et al. (2020).
