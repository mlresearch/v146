title: Empirical Comparison of Continuous and Discrete-time Representations for Survival
  Prediction
abstract: Survival prediction aims to predict the time of occurrence of a particular
  event of interest, such as the time until a patient dies. The main challenge in
  survival prediction is the presence of incomplete observations due to censoring.
  The classical formulation for survival prediction treats the survival time as a
  continuous outcome, which leads to a censored regression problem. Recent work has
  reformulated the survival prediction problem by discretizing time into a finite
  number of bins and then applying multi-task binary classification. While the discrete-time
  formulation is convenient and potentially requires less assumptions than the continuous-time
  approach, it also loses information by discretizing time. In this paper, we empirically
  investigate continuous and discrete-time representations for survival prediction
  to try to quantify the trade-offs between the two formulations. We find that discretizing
  time does not necessarily decrease prediction accuracy. Furthermore, discrete-time
  models can result in even more accurate predictors than continuous-time models,
  but the number of time bins used for discretization has a significant effect on
  accuracy and should thus be tuned as a hyperparameter rather than specified for
  convenience.
