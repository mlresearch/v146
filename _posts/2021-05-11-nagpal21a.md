title: Deep Parametric Time-to-Event Regression with Time-Varying Covariates
abstract: 'Time-to-event regression in healthcare and other domains, such as predictive
  maintenance, require working with time-series (or time-varying) data such as continuously
  monitored vital signs, electronic health records, or sensor readings. In such scenarios,
  the event-time distribution may have temporal dependencies at different time scales
  that are not easily captured by classical survival models that assume training data
  points to be independent. In this paper, we describe a fully parametric approach
  to model censored time-to-event outcomes with time varying covariates. It involves
  learning representations of the input temporal data using Recurrent Neural Networks
  such as LSTMs and GRUs, followed by describing the conditional event distribution
  as a fixed mixture of parametric distributions. The use of the recurrent neural
  networks allows the learned representations to model long-term dependencies in the
  input data while jointly estimating the Time-to-Event. We benchmark our approach
  on MIMIC III: a large, publicly available dataset collected from Intensive Care
  Unit (ICU) patients, focusing on predicting duration of their ICU stays and their
  short term life expectancy, and we demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed
  approach compared to established time-to-event regression models.'
