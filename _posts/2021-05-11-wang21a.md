title: 'Harmonic-Mean Cox Models: A Ruler for Equal Attention to Risk'
abstract: Survival analysis models are necessary for clinical forecasting with data
  censorship. Implicitly, existing works focus on the individuals with higher risks
  while lower risk individuals are poorly characterized. Developing survival models
  to represent different risk individuals equally is a challenging task but of great
  importance for providing accurate risk assessments across levels of risk. Here,
  we characterize this problem and propose an adjusted log-likelihood formulation
  as the new objective for survival prognostication. Several models are then proposed
  based on the newly designed optimization objective function which produce risks
  that count individuals “equally” on risk ratios thus providing representative attention
  to individuals of varying risk. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
  demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.
