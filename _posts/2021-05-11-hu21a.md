title: Transformer-Based Deep Survival Analysis
abstract: In this work, we propose a new Transformer-based survival model which estimates
  the patient-specific survival distribution. Our contributions are twofold. First,
  to the best of our knowledge, existing deep survival models use either fully connected
  or recurrent networks, and we are the first to apply the Transformer in survival
  analysis. In addition, we use ordinal regression to optimize the survival probabilities
  over time, and penalize randomized discordant pairs. Second, many survival models
  are evaluated using only the ranking metrics such as the concordance index. We propose
  to also use the absolute error metric that evaluates the precise duration predictions
  on observed subjects. We demonstrate our model on two publicly available real-world
  datasets, and show that our mean absolute error results are significantly better
  than the current models, meanwhile, it is challenging to determine the best model
  under the concordance index.
