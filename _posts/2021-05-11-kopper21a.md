title: Semi-Structured Deep Piecewise Exponential Models
abstract: We propose a versatile framework for survival analysis that combines advanced
  concepts from statistics with deep learning. The presented framework is based on
  piecewise exponential models and thereby supports various survival tasks, such as
  competing risks and multi-state modeling, and further allows for estimation of time-varying
  effects and time-varying features. To also include multiple data sources and higher-order
  interaction effects into the model, we embed the model class in a neural network
  and thereby enable the simultaneous estimation of both inherently interpretable
  structured regression inputs as well as deep neural network components which can
  potentially process additional unstructured data sources. A proof of concept is
  provided by using the framework to predict Alzheimer‘s disease progression based
  on tabular and 3D point cloud data and applying it to synthetic data.
