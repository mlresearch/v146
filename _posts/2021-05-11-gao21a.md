title: 'Multi-ethnic Survival Analysis: Transfer Learning with Cox Neural Networks'
abstract: Extensive collections of personal omics data from large clinical cohorts
  provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop high-performance machine learning
  systems for precision medicine. However, most clinical omics data were collected
  from individuals of European ancestry. Such ancestrally imbalanced data may lead
  to inaccurate machine learning models for the data-disadvantaged ethnic groups and
  thus generate new health care disparities. In this work, we develop a transfer learning
  scheme for survival analysis with multi-ethnic data. We perform machine learning
  experiments on real and synthetic clinical omics datasets to show that transfer
  learning can improve the prognostic accuracy of Cox neural network models for data-disadvantaged
  ethnic groups.
