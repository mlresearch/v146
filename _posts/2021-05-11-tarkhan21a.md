title: Survival Prediction Using Deep Learning
abstract: In many biomedical applications, outcome is measured as a “time-to-event”
  (e.g., time-to-disease progression or death). Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model
  has been widely used to assess the association between baseline characteristics
  of a patient and this outcome. Meanwhile, in therapeutic areas such as Oncology,
  clinical imaging (e.g. computerized tomography (CT) scan) is widely used for detection,
  diagnosis of disease, monitoring of progression and treatment effect. We are interested
  in using such images with neural network to build predictive models with survival
  data. However, the standard methodologies cannot be applied to imaging data with
  time-to-event outcome due to challenges such as memory constraint. In this work,
  we develop a simple methodology to engage images with survival data. Our proposed
  methodology is a modified version of CoxPH model that is amenable to SGD and allows
  us to overcome the existing challenges. We present the neural network architecture
  for the survival prediction using images. Our architecture can leverage new advances
  in network topology.
