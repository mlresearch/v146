title: WRSE - a non-parametric weighted-resolution ensemble for predicting individual
  survival distributions in the ICU
abstract: Dynamic assessment of mortality risk in the intensive care unit (ICU) can
  be used to stratify patients, inform about treatment effectiveness or serve as part
  of early-warning systems. Static risk scores, such as APACHE or SAPS, have been
  supplemented with data-driven approaches that track dynamic mortality risk over
  time. Recent works have focused on enhancing the information delivered to clinicians
  even further by producing full survival distributions instead of point predictions
  or fixed horizon risks. In this work, we propose a non-parametric ensemble model,
  Weighted Resolution Survival Ensemble (WRSE), tailored to estimate such dynamic
  individual survival distributions. Inspired by the simplicity and robustness of
  ensemble methods, the proposed approach combines a set of binary classifiers spaced
  according to a decay function reflecting the relevance of short-term predictions.
  Models and baselines are evaluated under weighted calibration and discrimination
  metrics for individual survival distributions, which closely reflect the utility
  of a model in ICU practice. We show competitive results with state-of-the-art probabilistic
  models, while greatly reducing training time by factors of 2-9x.
