title: 'Risk and Survival Analysis from COVID Outbreak Data: Lessons from India'
abstract: The present analysis is an attempt to provide data-backed evidence around
  mortality due to COVID-19 in Indian context. We provide a description of the prevailing
  COVID-19 conditions in India by means of succinct visualisation via a dynamic dashboard
  and cluster analysis. Building upon this, we performed survival analysis on COVID-19
  patients from the state of Karnataka, stratifying the data on the basis of age and
  gender. The findings of the same have been reported in this paper. To our knowledge,
  this is the largest retrospective cohort-based survival analysis in Indian context.
