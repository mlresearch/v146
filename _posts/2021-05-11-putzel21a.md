title: Dynamic Survival Analysis with Individualized Truncated Parametric Distributions
abstract: Dynamic survival analysis is a variant of traditional survival analysis
  where time-to-event predictions are updated as new information arrives about an
  individual over time. In this paper we propose a new approach to dynamic survival
  analysis based on learning a global parametric distribution, followed by individualization
  via truncating and renormalizing that distribution at different locations over time.
  We combine this approach with a likelihood-based loss that includes predictions
  at every time step within an individualâ€™s history, rather than just including one
  term per individual. The combination of this loss and model results in an interpretable
  approach to dynamic survival, requiring less fine tuning than existing methods,
  while still achieving good predictive performance. We evaluate the approach on the
  problem of predicting hospital mortality for a dataset with over 6900 COVID-19 patients.
