title: Exploring the Wasserstein metric for time-to-event analysis
abstract: 'Survival analysis is a type of semi-supervised task where the target output
  (the survival time) is often right-censored. Utilizing this information is a challenge
  because it is not obvious how to correctly incorporate these censored examples into
  a model. We study how three categories of loss functions can take advantage of this
  information: partial likelihood methods, rank methods, and our own classification
  method based on a Wasserstein metric (WM) and the non-parametric Kaplan Meier (KM)
  estimate of the probability density to impute the labels of censored examples. The
  proposed method predicts the probability distribution of an event, letting us compute
  survival curves and expected times of survival that are easier to interpret than
  the rank. We also demonstrate that this approach directly optimizes the expected
  C-index which is the most common evaluation metric for survival models.'
